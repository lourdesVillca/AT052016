Research :
When and why BDD was defined
	BDD come from the evolution of Test Driven Development(TDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Planning(ATDD)
	It was defined because BDD is a set of best practices for writing great tests and improves communication between 
	business and technical teams to create software with business value

The most important aspects of BDD

	the most importance aspects are:
	- The entire team collaborates in the development process
	- All team speak in the same languages that help us to understand what the other people speaks
	- easy feedback 
	- Focus on Behavior, how users will interact with the product. 
 
Why is useful and when could be applied.
It is useful because we can automate and run test cases in less time, we could applied this in the regression test level

Which type of teams could implement BDD
I think when we have a project that has and incremental developtment process we need to aply BDD

Structure of a feature – Give an example

	A feature should have
	Name: Save last search of contacts	
	Size: 45
	Priority: High

Structure of a user story – Give an example
A user story have Title, and a narrative section
	Title: 
	Narrative:
	As a [role]
	I want [feature]
	So that [benefit] 
Save the last searching in contact module  
As a contact administrator I want to see my last searched that I made, so that allow me to see the last selected or searched contact   

Structure of a scenario – Give an example
	Structure :
	Given some initial context (the givens)
	When an event occurs
	then ensure some outcomes

	Given that a contact name 
	when  he make a search for that contact
	then he should see his search parameters saved in the search section


Differences between BDD and BDT
BDD is to make and define the scenario 
BDT is a set of automated test cases and this is a branch of BDD
